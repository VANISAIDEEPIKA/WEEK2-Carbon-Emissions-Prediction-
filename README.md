# 🌍 Carbon Emission Prediction  

This repository contains the work done for **Week 2** of the Carbon Emission Prediction project under the AICTE–Edunet Internship.  
Edunet–Shell Skills4Future AICTE internship focused on Green skills & AI.

**In Week 1**, I focused on **raw data preparation**:
- Downloaded the raw climate change dataset
- Inspected and cleaned missing or inconsistent values
- Saved the cleaned dataset as `data_cleaned.csv` for reuse

**In Week 2**, I expanded into **Data Exploration & Feature Engineering**:
- Loaded the cleaned dataset
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generated descriptive statistics & visualizations
- Explored correlations between key features
- Prepared features for modeling carbon emission predictions

✅ **All Week 2 work is documented in** `2_data_exploration_cleaned.ipynb`.
